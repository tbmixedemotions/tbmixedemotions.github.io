								I truly love your voice and the passion it translates, it transcends emotions. Your music both translates feelings and transcends emotions I think, because emotions move and change depending on what happens but when you can use music to transcend an emotion you always have a place to come back to no matter what -  the music, you - your true self .💗

Your music is transcendental, and the intense emotions I feel listening to your darkest, deepest records have never faltered.  Time for some mixed emotions now 🖤

								Being able to see the flashes emotional and self awareness is amazing. No one will be able to see the full thing but doing through intense therapy it’s honestly quite easy to see someone who has started or has gone through the same. I’ve been a fan from grade 11 and hopefully Ill link you soon when I start working with the Argos front office haha
