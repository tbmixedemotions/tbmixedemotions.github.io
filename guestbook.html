								I was expecting it to be like this… I grew up fast that’s all I can say.  I experienced situations where I never thought I would come out alive and it just all blurred together and felt so surreal and I could never really communicate but through ur music it felt like I was talking and releasing all trauma. So Thankyou so much for being my friend 🙏

								I truly love your voice and the passion it translates, it transcends emotions. Your music both translates feelings and transcends emotions I think, because emotions move and change depending on what happens but when you can use music to transcend an emotion you always have a place to come back to no matter what -  the music, you - your true self .💗
