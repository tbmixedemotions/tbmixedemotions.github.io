I experienced situations where I never thought I would come out alive and it just all blurred together and felt so surreal and I could never really communicate but through ur music it felt like I was talking and releasing all trauma.

								I truly love your voice and the passion it translates, it transcends emotions. Your music both translates feelings and transcends emotions I think, because emotions move and change depending on what happens but when you can use music to transcend an emotion you always have a place to come back to no matter what -  the music, you - your true self .💗

								What’s good Roy!  Been listening to your music for a minute at this point. I went to your concert back in 2018 for your Say Less album, it was litttt!  Even without the show, I got too many memories with your songs intertwined in them, you got so many underrated hits!  Can’t wait to hear this new album! Be well and safety!

								Roy, I remember hearing “I got” on SoundCloud back in 2015 and was struck cuz I never heard nothing like that. Then I found “all of you” & “jealousy” and I knew I found my favorite artist. Your music is transcendental, and the intense emotions I feel listening to your darkest, deepest records have never faltered.  Time for some mixed emotions now 🖤

								I once met a musician that said music is this souls ways of interpreting life. The way enter twines mind, body and heart only a creator, so divine to have created something so magical. The mix of emotions that you create with your music. Shows how connected you are. Thanks for sharing. Thanks for creating. Thanks for your journey.
